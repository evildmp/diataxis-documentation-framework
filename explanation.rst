About explanation
=================

..  rubric:: Explanation is **discussion** that clarifies and illuminates a particular topic. Explanation is
    **understanding-oriented**.

===========

Explanation clarifies, deepens and broadens the reader’s understanding of a subject.

It's not concerned with what the user might be doing, like tutorials and how-to guides. It's not a close-up view of the
machinery, like reference material. It's documentation that approaches a topic from a higher perspective, and from
different angles.

This allows explanation to become *discussion*, a more relaxed, freer way to consider something. Explanation joins
things together. It's documentation that it makes sense to read while away from the product itself.

===========

The value and place of explanation
----------------------------------

Explanation and understanding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explanation, unlike the other three forms of documentation, doesn't have a direct part in a user's practice or work.
This means that it's sometimes seen as being of lesser importance. That's a mistake; it may be less *urgent* than the
other three, but it's no less *important*. It's not a luxury. No practitioner of a craft can afford to be without an
understanding of that craft, and needs the explanatory material that will help weave it together.

..  sidebar:: Explanation by any other name

    Your explanation documentation doesn't need to be called *Explanation*. Alternatives include:

    * *Discussion*
    * *Background*
    * *Conceptual guides*
    * *Topics*

In most European languages, words that mean *understanding* share roots in words meaning to hold or grasp. That's an
important part of understanding, to be able to hold something or be in possession of it. It seals together the other
components of our mastery of a craft, and makes it safely our own.

Understanding doesn't simply *come from* explanation, but explanation is required to form that web that helps hold
everything together. Without it, the practitioner's knowledge of their craft is loose and fragmented and fragile, and
their exercise of it is *anxious*.


Explanation and its boundaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's fairly rare to see explanation given its own section in documentation, and the idea that things need to be
explained is often only faintly expressed. Instead, explanation tends to be scattered in small parcels in other
sections.

It's not always easy to write good explanatory material. Where does one start? It's also not clear where to conclude.
There is an open-endedness about it that can give the writer too many possibilities.

Tutorials, how-to-guides and reference are all clearly defined in their scope by something that is also well-defined:
by what you need the user to learn, what task the user needs to achieve, or just by the scope of the machine itself.

In the case of explanation, it's useful to have a real or imagined *why* question to serve as a prompt. Otherwise, you
simply have to draw some lines that mark out a reasonable area and be satisfied with that.

Analogy from cooking
--------------------


In 1984 Harold McGee published *On food and cooking*.

    :alt:
    :class: floated

The book doesn't teach how to cook anything. It doesn't contain recipes (except as historical examples) and it isn't a
work of reference. Instead, it places food and cooking in the context of history, society, science and technology. It
explains for example why we do what we do in the kitchen and how that has changed.

It considers its subject from multiple different perspectives, using them to illuminate it in different ways.

After reading a book like *On food and cooking*, our understanding is changed. Our knowledge is richer and deeper. We
may not have learned anything that we can apply in practice, or that will change what we do, but **it will change how
we think about our craft**, and that is just as valuable.

It's something we might read at our leisure, away from the kitchen itself, when we want
to think about cooking at a higher level, and to understand more about the subject.

Writing good explanation
-----------------------------------

Make connections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When writing explanation you are helping to weave a web of understanding for your readers. **Make connections** to
other things, even to things outside the immediate topic, if that helps.


Provide context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Provide background and context in your explanation**: explain *why* things are so - design decisions, historical
reasons, technical constraints - draw implications, mention specific examples.


Talk *about* the subject
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..  sidebar:: Things to discuss

    * the bigger picture
    * history
    * choices, alternatives, possibilities
    * why: reasons and justifications

Explanation guides are *about* a topic in the sense that they are *around* it. Even the names of your explanation
guides should reflect this; you should be able to place an implicit (or even explicit) *about* in front of each
title. For example: *About user authentication*, or *About database connection policies*.


Discuss alternatives and opinions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Explanation can consider alternatives**, counter-examples or multiple different approaches to the same question.
You're not giving instruction or describing facts - you're opening up the topic for consideration. It helps to think of
explanation as discussion: discussions can even consider and weigh up contrary *opinions*.


Don't instruct, or provide technical reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One risk of explanation is that other things can tend to creep in. **Explanation should do things that the other parts of the documentation do not.** It’s not the place of an explanation to instruct the user in how to do something. Nor should it provide technical description. These functions of documentation are already taken care of in other sections.

==============

The language of explanation
--------------------------------

*The reason for x is because historically, y...*
    Explain.
*W is better than z, because...*
    Offer judgements and even opinions where appropriate..
*An x in system y is analogous to a w in system z. However...*
     Provide context that helps the reader.
*Some users prefer w (because z). This can be a good approach, but...*
    Weigh up alternatives.
*An x interacts with a y as follows:...*
    Unfold the machinery's internal secrets, to help understand why something does what it does.
