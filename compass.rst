The compass
=======================

The Diátaxis map is an effective reminder of the different kinds of
documentation and their relationship, and it accords well with intuitions
about documentation.

However intuition is not always to be relied upon. Often when working with
documentation, an author is faced with the question: *what form of
documentation is this?* or *what form of documentation is needed here?* - and
no obvious, intuitive answer.

Worse, sometimes intuition provides an immediate answer that is also wrong.

A map is most powerful in unfamiliar territory when we also have a compass to
guide us.

The Diátaxis compass is something like a truth-table or decision-tree of
documentation. It reduces a more complex, two-dimensional problem to its
simpler parts, and provides the author with a course-correction tool.


.. list-table::
   :widths: 33 33 34
   :header-rows: 1
   :stub-columns: 0
   :class: wider

   * - If the content describes...
     - ...and serves the user's...
     - ...then it must belong to...
   * - practical steps
     - study
     - a tutorial
   * - practical steps
     - work
     - a how-to guide
   * - theoretical knowledge
     - work
     - reference
   * - theoretical knowledge
     - study
     - explanation

The compass can be applied equally to user situations that need documentation,
or to documentation itself that perhaps needs to be moved or improved.

To use the compass, two questions need to be asked:

  Are we dealing with **practical steps** (action, something someone will *do*),
  or are we dealing with **theoretical knowledge** (propositional knowledge,
  information, something someone will only *think*)?

and:

  Are we dealing with **study** (the *acquisition* of skills and knowledge)
  or **work** (the *application* of skills and knowledge)?

Using the compass is itself something that becomes more effective and accurate
with practice, but it quickly becomes a useful decision-making tool.
