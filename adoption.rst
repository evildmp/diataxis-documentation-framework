       Adopted by IBM LoopBack, Cloudflare and dozens of other products and projects, the Diátaxis framework provides a
       lightweight and flexible architecture for technical documentaion.

Who's using Diátaxis?
=============================================

..  epigraph::

    At Gatsby we recently reorganized our open-source documentation, and the Diátaxis framework was our go-to resource
    throughout the project. The four quadrants helped us prioritize the user’s goal for each type of documentation. By
    restructuring our documentation around the Diátaxis framework, we made it easier for users to discover the
    resources that they need when they need them.
