===================

Diátaxis is the work of Daniele Procida.

The principles described in this website have been developed over a number of
years, and continue to be elaborated and explored.


Origins and development
-----------------------

The original context for this approach was software product documentation,
which remains their principal application.

More recent work has seen them applied at scale in internal corporate
documentation, in scientific research contexts, organisational management and
education.


Divio and Diátaxis
-------------------

The key concepts behind Diátaxis first crystallised while working at
`Divio <https://divio.com>`_, the cloud applications platform.

I presented these ideas at conferences in early 2017, and as they gained a
fuller form, wrote them up as `The documentation system
<http://documentation.divio.com>`_ for Divio.

The thinking and approaches I elaborated while working at Divio are at the
core of the Diátaxis documentation philosophy. I remain grateful to Divio for
the long and fruitful collaboration that provided me with the opportunity to
develop and express these ideas. Divio should be acknowledged as having
helped nurture them.

Since leaving Divio in 2021 I have continued to research and refine my
approaches and methods in documentation, now published here.

For the sake of clarity, *the material published at
https://documentation.divio.com/ is Divio's intellectual property and is
rightfully there*. Divio has behaved with appropriate courtesy and
propriety throughout my time working at the company, and since then.

**Do not approach or hassle Divio demanding explanations.**
