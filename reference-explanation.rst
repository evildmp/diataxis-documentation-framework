Explanation and reference
==========================

Explanation and reference both belong to the *theory* half of the Di√°taxis map - they don't contain
steps to guide the reader, they contain theoretical knowledge.

The difference between them is - just as in the difference between tutorials and how-to guides - the
difference between the *acquisition* of skill and knowledge, and its *application*. In other words
it's the distinction between *study* and *work*.


A straightforward distinction, *mostly*
----------------------------------------

Mostly it's fairly straightforward to recognise whether you're dealing with one or the other.
*Reference*, as a form of writing, is well understood; it's used in distinctions we make about
writing from an early age.

In addition, examples of writing are themselves often clearly one or the other. A tidal chart,
with its tables of figures, is clearly reference material. An article that explains *why* there
are tides and how they behave is self-evidently explanation.

There are good rules of thumb.

**If it's boring and unmemorable** it's probably *reference*.

**Lists of things** (such as classes or methods or attributes), and **tables of
information**, will generally turn out to belong in *reference*.

On the other **if you can imagine reading something in the bath**, probably, it's
*explanation* (though really there is no accounting for what people might read
in the bath).

Imagine asking a friend, while out for a walk or over a drink, **Can you
tell me more about <topic>?** - the answer or discussion that follows is
most likely going to be an *explanation* of it.


... but intuition isn't reliable enough
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mostly we can rely safely on intuition to manage the distinction between
reference and explanations. But only *mostly* - because it's also quite easy
to slip between one form and the other.

It usually happens while writing reference material that starts to become expansive. For example,
it's perfectly reasonable to include illustrative examples in reference (just as an encyclopaedia
might contain illustrations) - but examples are fun things to develop, and it can be tempting to
develop them into explanation (using them to say *why*, or show *what if*, or how it came to be).

As a result one often finds explanatory material sprinkled into reference. This is bad for the
reference, interrupted and obscured by digressions. But it's bad for the explanation too, because
it's not allowed to develop appropriately and do its own work.


Work and study
--------------

The real test though if we're in doubt about whether we're something is or is supposed to be
reference or explanation is: is this something someone would turn to while working, that is, while
actually getting something done, executing a task? Or is it something they'd need once they have
stepped away from the work, and want to think about it?


These are two very fundamentally different *needs* of the reader, that reflect how, at that moment,
the reader stands in relation to the craft in question, in a relationship of *work* or *study*.

	To help avoid being mislead by intuition, see :ref:`compass`.

**Reference** is what a user needs in order help *apply* knowledge and skill, while they
are working.

**Explanation** is what someone will turn to to help them *acquire* knowledge
and skill - "study".


Understanding those two relationships and responding to the needs in them is the key to creating
effective reference and explanation.
