"Reference guides have one job only: to describe. They are code-"

"certain method, for example, or precautions that must be taken when "
"passing something to a function. However this is simply part of its "
"function as technical reference, and emphatically **not** to be confused "
"with a how-to guide - *describing correct usage of software* (technical "
"reference) is not the same as *showing how to use it to achieve a certain"
" end* (how-to documentation)."
