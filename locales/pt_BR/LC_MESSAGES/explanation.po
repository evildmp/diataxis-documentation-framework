"Explanations can equally well be described as *discussions*; they are "
"discursive in nature. They are a chance for the documentation to relax "
"and step back from the software, taking a wider view, illuminating it "
"from a higher level or even from different perspectives. You might "
"imagine a discussion document being read at leisure, rather than over the"
" code."

"This section of documentation is rarely explicitly created, and instead, "
"snippets of explanation are scattered amongst other sections. Sometimes, "
"the section exists, but has a name such as *Background* or *Other notes* "

"A topic isn’t defined by a specific task you want to achieve, like a how-"
"to guide, or what you want the user to learn, like a tutorial. It’s not "
"defined by a piece of the machinery, like reference material. It’s "
"defined by what **you** think is a reasonable area to try to cover at one"
" time, so the division of topics for discussion can sometimes be a little"
" arbitrary."
