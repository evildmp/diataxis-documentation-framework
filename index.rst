    The Grand Unified Theory of Documentation

    -- David Laing


Diátaxis is an approach to :doc:`quality <quality>` in technical documentation. It describes
an information architecture that emerges from a systematic approach to understanding the needs of
documentation users.

..  sidebar::

    The name *Diátaxis* comes from the Ancient Greek δῐᾰ́τᾰξῐς: *dia* ("across") and *taxis*
    ("arrangement").

Diátaxis identifies four modes of documentation - **tutorials**, **how-to guides**, **technical reference** and
**explanation**. It derives its structure from the relationship between them.

In Diátaxis, each of these modes (or types) corresponds to a different user
need. Each fulfils a different purpose and requires a different approach to
its creation.

Technical documentation should be structured explicitly around these four types, and should keep them separate and
distinct from each other.

In other words, what we call *documentation* is fundamentally not one thing, but four. Understanding the implications
of this, and how those four different things work, can help improve most documentation.

    While redesigning the `Cloudflare developer docs <https://developers.cloudflare.com>`_, Diátaxis became our north
    star for information architecture. When we weren’t sure where a new piece of content should fit in, we’d consult
    the framework. Our documentation is now clearer than it’s ever been, both for readers and contributors.

    -- Adam Schwartz (`@AdamSchwartz <https://github.com/adamschwartz>`_)

Diátaxis is light-weight, easy to understand and straightforward to apply. It doesn't impose implementation
constraints. It brings an active principle of quality to documentation. It helps make projects, and the teams that work
with them, more successful.

Diátaxis is :ref:`proven in practice <adoption>` across a wide variety of fields and applications, in large
and small, open and proprietary documentation projects.
